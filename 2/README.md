# Challenge 2

Download this dataset: http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2016-general/sov/csv-ballot-measures.xls

It lists Yes/No votes for every ballot measure in California for every county in the 2016 election.

Create an interesting data visualization using this data. Maps, charts, even a shiny app would all be fine.


BONUS: Combine this dataset with a new dataset to create your data. For example, combine this dataset with the population numbers for each country to find voter participation, then make a visualization based on that. Or download the Clinton, Trump vote numbers and show a relationship between voting for a presidential candidate and for/against a ballot measure.
